A Python version of "De Slimste Mens Ter Wereld"

In December of 2016, I created a version of "De Slimste Mens Ter Wereld" for use at home. Unfortunately, I made some questionable technology choices back then. To not let all my past efforts go to waste, I decided to recreate this version in Python while reusing all the assets I created back then. This means that for now, I am focussing on the version of De Slimste Mens from 2016.
